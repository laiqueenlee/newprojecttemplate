# Problem Statements 

## 1 Poor search functionality
Students are having difficulties when searching for books as the system is restricted to searching by bookâ€™s title and author only. Students have to search through physical shelves because most of the time they only remember partial information about the book such as the author or some keywords from the title. Students are unable to locate the book and have no idea if books have been borrowed. This would be time-consuming and tiresome. It is also inefficient in processing borrowed and returned books when many students are waiting because it is required to enter the whole title of the books every time.
